# Minesweepa

<p>My first look into APIs with Posts and Gets. I particularly enjoyed styling this one and making it my own.

<p>Objectives:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
    Created the site using React
    </li>
    <li>
    Used Fetch to GET and POST game data to and from this <a href="https://minesweeper-api.herokuapp.com/">Minesweeper API</a>
    </li>
    <li>
    Used state to update the game
    </li>
    <li>
    Added background music to listen to while playing
    </li>
  </ul>
